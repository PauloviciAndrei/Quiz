 # Unity Quiz Game

## Description
This project is a simple multiple-choice quiz game built with the Unity game engine. It presents a series of questions to the player, each with a selection of answers to choose from. Each question is timed, adding a fun challenge to answer before time runs out. The game keeps track of the player's score and displays a summary at the end of the quiz.

## Features
- **Timed Questions:** Each question has a countdown timer to limit how long you have to answer.  
- **Score System:** The game tracks correct answers and calculates a final score (as a percentage of questions answered correctly).  
- **Progress Indicator:** A progress bar shows how far along you are in the quiz, and after each question the correct answer is revealed for immediate feedback.  
- **End Screen Summary:** At the end of the quiz, a results screen displays your total score and offers a button to restart the quiz.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity:** Used as the game engine to build and run the quiz game.  
- **C#:** All game logic is scripted in C# (Unity's primary programming language).  
- **Unity UI & TextMeshPro:** Utilized for the user interface, including buttons, text, and the question display.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game:** Launch the quiz game. The first question will appear on the screen with multiple-choice answer options.  
2. **Answer Questions:** Select an answer by clicking one of the option buttons before the timer for that question runs out.  
3. **Feedback:** After you answer (or time runs out), the correct answer is displayed so you know if you got it right.  
4. **Next Question:** The game automatically moves on to the next question. Continue answering each new question that appears.  
5. **Quiz End:** When you’ve answered all the questions, an end screen will show your final score. You can then press the **Restart** button to play the quiz again.

## Future Improvements
- **More Questions & Categories:** Add a larger variety of questions or multiple categories/topics to expand the game’s content.  
- **Difficulty Levels:** Introduce difficulty settings (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard) that adjust the time limit or question complexity for different skill levels.  
- **High Score Tracking:** Implement a system to save high scores or a leaderboard so players can see their best scores over time.  
- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Improve the visual and audio feedback with better graphics, animations, and sound effects to make the quiz more engaging.
